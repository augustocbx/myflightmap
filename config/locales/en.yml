        Welcome to MyFlightMap, your site for keeping track of your flights and trips!
        Organise your flights into trips, see stats about your flying, share links
        with your friends and family rather than forwarding itineraries.


        Automatically import trips by forwarding confirmation emails, import
        your FlightMemory data, or create flights and trips by hand.


        We love flying and stats, and are working to improve this app. If you encounter
        and difficulty or have suggestions we'd love to hear from you.
        If you're a designer and want to make this site pretty, we definitely
        want to hear from you. Send an email to [info@myflightmap.com](mailto:info@myflightmap.com).

          Note: This will not automatically mark flights in this trip as private.
          The trip itself won't be listed, but the individual flights will be unless you mark them as private too!
